FFmpeg auto generated unsafe bindings for C#/.NET, forked from https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen, optimized for:
* Using standard `[DllImport]` instead of `LoadLibrary`
* Minimized repository size, removed all ffmpeg `*.dll` binaries using `bfg`
* Auto download FFmpeg binaries from known existing sources
* Omiting shorter enum values like `AVCodecID.H264` instead of `AVCodecID.AV_CODEC_ID_H264`
* Omiting same prefix macro into a combined enum like `AVChannels.LayoutStereo` instead of `AV_CH_LAYOUT_STEREO`
* Other optimization and fixs...
